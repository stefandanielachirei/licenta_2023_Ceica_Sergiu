        "1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Choose appropriate operating system and download the **Python 3** installer:\n",

        "(\\*type the exact command as written and hit enter)\n",
        "\n",

        "### II. Set-Up: Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "We create virtual environments to use different version of applications and libraries. Virtual environments allow you to use isolated python environments to install different versions of libraries. Here, we will make a new virtual environment called `wids-datathon` and show you how to activate/deactive it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "1. **Open your Terminal** (for Windows, open Anaconda Prompt)  \n",
        "2. In your terminal, **run the command**:\n",
        "    `conda create -n wids-datathon python=3 anaconda`  \n",
        "    You've now created your virtual environment!  \n",
        "3. To **activate** this virtual environment, run:  \n",
        "    &ensp; \\- on Mac or Linux: `source activate wids-datathon`  \n",
        "    &ensp; \\- on Windows: `activate wids-datathon`  \n",

        "    \n",
        "    \n",
        "Remember to always activate your virtual environment first before you install packages or run a notebook. This prevents the potential of crashing your root Python/Anaconda installation.\n",

        "### III. Navigating Your Directories\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point, you can run the command to start your Jupyer Notebook server. However, it will open in your home directory and you will have to click through your folders to find the file you want to open. To prevent this, you can **navigate to the desired directory first** in the terminal, and open the server to that directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"directory\" is just another term for \"folder\" -- your Desktop folder is a directory, as are your Downloads, Documents, and OneDrive folders. All you are doing here is laying out the path you will take from your home directory to whichever folder you want to work from.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some basic commands in the terminal:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `cd <path to directory>`: you can navigate through your directories from your root with the `cd` command by specifying a path to your desired directory.\n",
        "    - e.g. If your home directory contains your `Desktop` folder, `cd Desktop` takes you from Home to your Desktop directory.\n",
        "    - e.g. If your `Desktop` folder contains folder `WiDS` which contains the folder `Datathon`, the following command from your Home Directory takes you to the Datathon folder: `cd Desktop/WiDS/Datathon`\n",
        "- `cd ..`: this allows you to go back to the previous directory (called the parent directory)\n",
        "    - e.g. `WiDS` is the parent folder of `Datathon`, so from the `Datathon` folder, `cd ..` will take you to the `WiDS` folder.\n",
        "- `ls` or `dir`: lists all folders/files in the current directory. This is a good way to check, for example, if your parent folder contains your Desktop folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you know how to navigate directories from your terminal! Find your desired directory **before** you run the JupyterHub Server to prevent clicking through layers of folders.\n",

        "### IV. Create Your First Notebook!\n",
        "\n",
        "Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebooks which is what we will use throughout this tutorial. In order to create your first notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Open your terminal (for Windows users, use Anaconda Prompt)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Activate your virtual environment\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Navigate to your desired directory\n",

        "\n",
        "Your default browser window will open, and you should be in your specified directory. From here, you can create a new notebook, open and edit saved notebooks, and much, much more!\n",
