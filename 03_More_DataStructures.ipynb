We also explored insights we can gain from computing summary statistics on those collections of data. Now we need a way to store and work with **multiple** separate collections of information about the same population - e.g. in addition to the test scores of the class, perhaps we also know the students' IDs, and results from one other exam they have taken in the past. In this notebook, we will work with data structures that allow us to store multiple pieces of information, or **features**, about a population; and we will explore a powerful library that allows us to read in, explore and manipulate datasets.\n",
